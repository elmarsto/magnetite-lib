# Magnetite Rust Library (magnetite-lib)

Library for building plugins in Rust for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

This library defines Rust traits, structs and impls that
aim to replicate, as much as possible, [the Typescript API](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/) for Obsidian plugin development.

It's intended to be used in conjunction with (a fork of?) [magnetite-host](https://github.com/elmarsto/magnetite-host/) and (almost certainly a fork of) [magnetite-guest](https://github.com/elmarsto/magnetite-guest/).

The Obsidian Plugin API is in early alpha, and thus, so is this!
